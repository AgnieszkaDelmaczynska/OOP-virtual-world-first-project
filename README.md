# OOP - Virtual World - first project - 2021

This project is a world simulation with various organisms represented by letters in the console.

The aim of the project was to improve my understanding of OOP.

Organisms have different behavior thanks to virtual methods of action and collision.

Base class Organism and its derived classes: Animal and Plant are examples of polymorphism and inheritance. 

All variables inside classes are appropriately encapsulated.

## Symbols of the organisms on the board

W – wilk (wolf)
O – owca (sheep)
L – lis (fox)
Z – żółw (turtle)
A – Antylopa (antelope)
t – trawa (grass)
m – mlecz (milkweed)
g – guarana (guarana)
w – wilcze jagody (nightshade)
b – barszcz Sosnowskiego (Sosnowski borscht)
człowiek - biały kwadracik, pozycja: 17,3 (human - white square, position: 17, 3)
