# OOP - Virtual World - first project - 2021

- This project is a world simulation with various organisms represented by letters in the console.

- The aim of the project was to improve my understanding of OOP.

- Organisms have different behavior thanks to virtual methods of action and collision.

- Base class Organism and its derived classes: Animal and Plant are examples of polymorphism and inheritance. 

- All variables inside classes are appropriately encapsulated.

## Symbols of the organisms on the board

W – wilk (wolf)
O – owca (sheep)
L – lis (fox)
Z – żółw (turtle)
A – Antylopa (antelope)
t – trawa (grass)
m – mlecz (milkweed)
g – guarana (guarana)
w – wilcze jagody (nightshade)
b – barszcz Sosnowskiego (Sosnowski borscht)
człowiek - biały kwadracik, pozycja: 17,3 (human - white square, position: 17, 3)
